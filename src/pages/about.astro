  <h2>Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Billy!</h2>
  <p>
    I'm a computer programmer; I contribute to open-source software projects;
    currently I'm a full-time Software Engineer at
    <a href="https://goodfrontend.dev">goodfrontend.dev</a>; aside from web
    development and cloud computing, I am enthusiastic about machine learning and
    cybersecurity. Occassionally, I tinker with IoT devices at home.
