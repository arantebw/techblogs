The personal computer hardware (machine) -- may it be a laptop or desktop -- is
of the most indispensable tool of a professional software developer. So,
personally taking some time to setup and install all of the needed applications
and stuff is tedious and time consuming especially if you just recently
acquired a new hardware.

I will try to document as much as possible how do I usually setup my machine
for software development. I think it would be nice to document how I setup my
machines based on the OS (Operating System) that I'm using.

## My list of active machines:

- [Lenovo Ideapad 310-15IKB + Fedora Linux](#)
- [Apple MacBook Pro M2 Pro + MacOS Ventura](#)
