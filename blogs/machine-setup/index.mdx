The personal computer hardware (machine) -- may it be a laptop or desktop -- is
of the most indispensable tool of a professional software developer. So,
personally taking some time to setup and install all of the needed applications
and stuff is tedious and time consuming especially if you just recently
acquired a new hardware.

I will try to document as much as possible how do I usually setup my machine
for software development.
