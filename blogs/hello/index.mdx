Yes, this is it!

This post is my first blog post to this personally crafted blog site.

This personal blog site will contain posts about my experiences revolving
around computer programming, open-source software, and web development.
Eventually, it will expand on other technology topics  (e.g., AI/ML,
blockchain, semantic web, etc.)  I am also interested.

I love writing, but I am not yet good at it, so this will become my go-to
platform to host my raw thoughts and newbie writing skills. I plan to make this
a biweekly habit of posting a new blog entry.

Also, this is the initial version of the blog site; I intend to upgrade this
using the skills I will acquire in modern web development. This project will
become a good practice project of mine.

I do not intend to make this a long post, as the title implies this is a "hello
world" blog entry.

Cheers!
